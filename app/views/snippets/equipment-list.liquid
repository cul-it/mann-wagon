    <h3>Should I make a reservation?</h3>

    <p>The same borrowing policies apply for both the reservable and first come, first served equipment. The main difference is you can come to the circ desk to pick up any available equipment on the spot, without first reserving it online. If, however, you need a piece of equipment on a specific date, then we would encourage you to make a reservation.
