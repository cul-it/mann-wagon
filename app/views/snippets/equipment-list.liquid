    <h3>Should I make a reservation?</h3>

    <p>The same policies apply for both the reservable and first come, first served equipment.<p>
    <p>The main difference is you can come to the circulation desk to pick up any available equipment on the spot, without first reserving it online. If, however, you need a piece of equipment on a specific date, then we encourage you to make a reservation.<p>
