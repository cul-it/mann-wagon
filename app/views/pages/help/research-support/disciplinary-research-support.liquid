      <p>Due to COVID-19, and until further notice, all consultations will be conducted online via Zoom.Â  At a minimum, this will allow us to have an audio conversation, optionally with video and screensharing, which can be very useful for demonstrating use of databases and troubleshooting.</p>
      <p>If you have not yet used Zoom at Cornell, please <a href="https://it.cornell.edu/zoom/install-zoom-software" title="Install Zoom application from Cornell IT website">install the free software</a> prior to the start of your consultation.</p>
